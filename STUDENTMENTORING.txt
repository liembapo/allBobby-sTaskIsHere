LOOP, CLASS AND OBJECT (BOBBY'S MENTORING) ,November 27 2019.

LOOP
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	What is Loop

	--> The Java for loop is a control flow statement that iterates a part of the programs multiple times. 
	 	The Java while loop is a control flow statement that executes a part of the programs repeatedly on the basis of given boolean condition.
	 	Loops are what make computers interesting machines. Without loops, computers would just be really sophisticated adding machines, and not much else.
	--> Why we use loop?
		because its helps us executing one or more statements up to a desired number of times.(saving our time rather than write it manually)

	there are some loop which are we know :

	1.for loop/traditional loop
	2.while loop
	3.do while loop
	4.for each (for array and class collection only)

---------------------------------------------
	1. Traditional for loop:
	   
	   When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:
		
		Syntax: 
			
			for(dataType var ; condition ; Step){
				
				action/statement
			}

		- when you need variable to help you to do some action, or pointing the index of an array or a string
		- the condition required false, in order to stop the loop
		- you can use variable as many as you want but should be in 1 datatype
		- you can change the flow of the loop by continue, break and return.
				> 	continue:
					ask you to go to the next itineration and ignoring the rest of the statement on that loop.
				>	break:
					force you to go out from the loop.if its on inner loop it will bring you to outer loop. if there only 1 loop it will bring you out from the loop
				>	return:
					force you to stop the program straight away.
		- when we pointing for some data,object or element which is doesnt exist,the entire program will be shut down (for this case we will learn about execption).
	
	2. 	While loop:
		
		Syntax:
		When you are not sure how many times your code will be iterated.
			
			while(condition){

				action/Statement

			}

		-  it will check the condition in the begining 
		-  while loop allows us to specify that a certain statement is to be executed repetitively until the loop condition is false, but we have to inisiate some    	   variable in order the code to go through the loop.
		-  while loop is similar like for loop, only the structure is different

	
	3. 	Do while loop:
		
		Syntax :

		do{
			action/statement

		}while(condition);

	-	at least the loop will be executed 1 time.
	-	it will check the condition in the end of body
	-	iteration ends when condition met the false statement.

	4. for each loop

		Syntax :

		for(dataType varName : ArrayName){
			
			action/statement

		}
		
		- used when we dont need to read the index.
		- used when we dont need any helper variable to run the code.
		- we couldn't change the array but we can take the value, or just check the value.
		- Itâ€™s commonly used to iterate over an array or a Collections class (eg, ArrayList)

CLASS AND OBJECT

	-->	a class is a programming language construct that is used as a blueprint to create objects.
		This blueprint includes attributes and methods that the created objects all share.
	
	Class
	-	when we decide to create a new class mean we are creating a new data type
	-	Usually, a class represents a person, place, or thing - it is an abstraction of a concept within a computer program.
		its like drawing on canvas for artist , but its like describing something(object) on virtual page(class) for programmer.
	-	Class has instance variable, method described here , and constructor (depend on the programmer needs).
	-	There are some type of class but so far we learn only regular Classes
	-	When you're going to use this class on different package, you have to import this class.
	- 	by default this class works only within its package.

	Object
	-	creating object on java, simply mean describing a real object on virtual page
	- 	Object normally always has a instance variable which is always following the object once its created on main class
